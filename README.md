# Algorithms
learning algorithm note. First you need to know basic data structure, such as arrays and linked list and stack and queue. I will classify and sort, learn step by step. Mainly learning LeetCode problem's solutions.You can run the code to learn more. For example, In the tow sum example run it and input the text
```text
[2,7,11,15]
9
```
